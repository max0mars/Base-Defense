Documentation to help me remeber and for consistency across files and programs. 
Write here when you make a design choice that must be consistent or 
something you want to implement in the future and don't wan to forget

Hitboxes:
- AABB
- Beam weapons: use angular distance?
- hitbox x,y may be different than obj x and y.
- use hitbox:getX / :getY / :getXY

Stat names:

Shapes:
- Shapes (whether hitbox or entity) will all use 'size' to define size
- DRAWING: x/y is ALWAYS centered
- circle: size = radius
- square: size = length = height
- triangle: size = length of sides

For Enemies, Player Units, etc.:
Things that aren't initialized when creating new Object:
- size, w, h, shape, game, tag, 

BUILDINGS




*Not Implemented Yet*
ADVANCED SWARM TARGETING system
- all enemies have a variable called incoming damage
- when a tower shoots an enemy, adds damage to incoming damage variable
- when chosing a target, towers will check if incoming damage is enough to kill the enemy
- if incoming dmg > hp then find a new target
